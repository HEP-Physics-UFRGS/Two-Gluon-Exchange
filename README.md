# Study of Total and Differential Cross Sections and Beta Parameter Based on Nonperturbative Gluon Exchange in \(pp\) Elastic Scattering

This repository contains research and analysis related to the paper titled **"Nonperturbative gluon exchange in \(pp\) elastic scattering at TeV energies"** by G. B. Bopsin et al. The study focuses on the two-gluon-exchange model of the Pomeron, incorporating nonperturbative gluon propagators with dynamical mass scales to describe high-energy proton-proton (\(pp\)) scattering data.

## Key Findings

1. **Total and Differential Cross Sections**:
   - The model successfully describes LHC data for \(pp\) elastic scattering at \(\sqrt{s} = 7\), 8, and 13 TeV.
   - The differential cross section \(d\sigma/dt\) is analyzed using a cumulant expansion for the proton form factor, with the best fit achieved for \(N_a = 2\) (quadratic in \(|t|\)).

2. **Dynamical Gluon Mass**:
   - Two types of dynamical gluon masses are considered: logarithmic (\(m_{log}\)) and power-law (\(m_{pl}\)).
   - The gluon mass \(m_g\) is found to be sensitive to the dataset (ATLAS or TOTEM) and the type of mass.

3. **Beta Parameter (\(\beta_0\))**:
   - The strength of the Pomeron coupling to quarks, \(\beta_0\), is calculated using the dynamical gluon mass.
   - For ATLAS data:  
     - \(\beta_{0,\text{ATLAS}} = 2.33^{+0.39}_{-0.30} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}\) (logarithmic mass)  
     - \(\beta_{0,\text{ATLAS}} = 2.13^{+0.33}_{-0.25} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}\) (power-law mass)  
   - For TOTEM data:  
     - \(\beta_{0,\text{TOTEM}} = 2.04^{+0.28}_{-0.22} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}\) (logarithmic mass)  
     - \(\beta_{0,\text{TOTEM}} = 1.91^{+0.22}_{-0.19} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}\) (power-law mass)  

4. **Reggeization and Nonperturbative QCD**:
   - The scattering amplitude is Reggeized to match high-energy behavior.
   - Nonperturbative effects are incorporated through QCD effective charges and gluon propagators derived from Schwinger-Dyson equations.
